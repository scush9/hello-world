Hi, my name is Sal.
I am from NYC but recently moved to Florida.
Over a year ago, graduated from an Industrial Organizational Psychology Master's program where I discovered my interest in coding and data analytics. 
I am completing this activity for the OMDS Data Science Bootcamp.
I look forward to being a student in this program.
